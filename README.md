For my chosen application I created a multiple room chat where clients can connect to different rooms/channels and chat with 
the other clients in the same room as them.
In order to get it working you must have node.j installed along with npm. To run the file you simply 
type "http://localhost:3000/" intoyour url and the application should appear.

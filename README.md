For my chosen application I created a multiple room chat where clients can connect to different rooms/channels and chat with 
the other clients in the same room as them.
In order to get it working you must have node.js installed along with npm. 

After you have download the zip file from my git hub you then should rename the foler that the project is in to "chatter"

After you have renamed the foler you will have to access your terminal and cd to the correct directory with the folder.
Then you should run 'npm' into the command line, and after that run 'npm start' to get the server running.

type "http://localhost:3000/" intoyour url and the application should appear.
